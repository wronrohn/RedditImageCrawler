# RedditImageCrawler

I made this script as a mini side project.


## Requirements for the script

Use the command "pip3 libraryname --install" to install all missing libraries

- praw
- pandas
- datetime
- os
- urllib
- shutil

## Usage

1. Open app.py
2. Change the name of the Subreddit on the 29th line of code.
3. On the 35th line of code change the Limit. Limit decides how many images you do want to download from a given subreddit.
4. Open command line on your computer.
5. Make sure you have python 3 installed.
6. Write the command - python3 app.py
7. Check the directory where your app.py is located you should now find a new folder with the name of your specified subreddit.
